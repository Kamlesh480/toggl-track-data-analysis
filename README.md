Toggl Track Data Analysis Project Summary
The goal of this project is to analyze my time tracking data from the past 6 months using Toggl Track. The data includes records of various activities, such as coding, project work, attending calls, conducting research, and more.

To achieve this goal, I plan to perform the following steps:

Data cleaning: I will remove any duplicates or irrelevant data, and ensure that the data is formatted correctly and ready for analysis.

Data exploration: I will explore the data using descriptive statistics and visualizations to gain a better understanding of my work patterns, productivity, and time management habits.

Time breakdown: I will analyze the data to determine how much time I spend on each activity, and identify any patterns or trends in my work habits.

Productivity analysis: I will calculate my overall productivity levels and examine factors that may impact my productivity, such as the time of day, day of the week, and type of activity.

Recommendations: Based on the insights gained from the analysis, I will develop recommendations for how I can optimize my time management and work habits to improve my productivity and efficiency.

Overall, this project aims to provide me with valuable insights into my work habits, productivity levels, and time management skills. By analyzing the data, I hope to identify areas where I can improve and develop actionable recommendations for optimizing my work patterns going forward.
